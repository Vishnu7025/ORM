# ORM
**ORM** stands for Object Relational Mapper. The main goal of ORM is to send data between a database and models in an application. 
It maps a relation between the database and a model. So, ORM maps object attributes to fields of a table.
The main advantage of using ORM is that it makes the entire development process fast and error-free. Essentially, it eliminates the need to write SQL code.
